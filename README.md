# youwont.bet

React + Python (Flask) + Docker app for ingesting and processing user-submitted photos.

------
youwont.bet was created as a promotional website for the [vlush](https://instagram.com/vlushairlines) debut album [WHO 250](http://youwont.bet).

The application displays a slot-machine graphic with a dynamically generated image composed of user-submitted photos which were eventually used to generate the WHO 250 album artwork. Users upload photos to the website, where they are then submitted to a Slack channel for approval or rejection. Upon approval, images are added to the collage on the front page of the site.

Developed in collaboration with [@thomasjfox1](https://github.com/thomasjfox1) and [@rainmayecho](https://github.com/rainmayecho).
